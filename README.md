# City Generation Project

This project will be the code used to simulate what's being discussed on my Undergraduate Thesis. 

The project will aim to generate a city, from the terrain to the urban furniture, including roads and buildigs.

The following list contains the work of the project:
- [X] Terrain label generator
- [x] Road L-System generator
- [x] Road randomness generator
- [X] Road asset placer
- [X] Building generator
- [X] Urban furniture generator

The list will increase in size as the steps of the project are ironed out. There is a Trello with the current tasks in development and the tasks done per sprint: [Trello project](https://trello.com/b/Hwj5aP2c/tfg-alberto-barrag√°n "A tidy way to see the project's development")
